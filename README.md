> **About this coding expirience:**  
> This was the first time I wrote an entire code all alone. Of course I took a look at the lesson code but I tried hard to understand the concepts and the computational thinking to make it work.  
> I must say that wasnÂ´t easy to me. To add a dificulty layer I acidentally started the project with TypeScript and it was dreadfull and worthy at the same time. Too many time actually. TypeScript held me back, but now I know it better and the next project may be a project that TS makes a difference. 
>**[New delete features]** - Implementing the button to clear all tasks was relatively easy. I stroggled for some time to delete just the done tasks. To do so, I needed to learn how to filter <taskList>, a array of objects, by the <object.id> and I could feed a <checkedTaskList> with the checked task. Then create <onlyUnCheckedList> by filtering <checkedTaskList> to up date <taskList>.
>The most defianty was keep the lists immutability.
