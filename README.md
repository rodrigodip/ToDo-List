> **About this coding expirience:**  
> This was the first time I wrote an entire code all alone. Of course I took a look at the lesson code but I tried hard to understand the concepts and the computational thinking to make it work.  
> I must say that wasnÂ´t easy to me. To add a dificulty layer I acidentally started the project with TypeScript and it was dreadfull and worthy at the same time. Too many time actually. TypeScript held me back, but now I know it better and the next project may be a project that TS makes a difference.
